# OCR Skill Recognition

A developer guide covering the image preprocessing pipeline, Tesseract configuration, fuzzy skill matching, and tuning parameters.

---

## 1. Architecture Overview

The OCR pipeline consists of three modular layers, lazy-loaded on first use to avoid slowing down initial page load:

![OCR Pipeline](images/ocr-pipeline.svg)

```
Image Input
    |
    v
[ocr-preprocess.js]  Image Preprocessing
    |  - Upscale (2x/3x)
    |  - Grayscale + CLAHE contrast
    |  - Denoise (median filter)
    |  - Adaptive threshold (Sauvola) or Otsu
    |  - Morphological close
    |  - Multi-variant output (4 configs tested in parallel)
    v
[Tesseract.js v7]    OCR Engine (English)
    |  - PSM AUTO, char whitelist
    |  - Per-word confidence scores
    |  - Worker pool (up to 3 parallel workers)
    v
[ocr-matcher.js]     Fuzzy Matching + Confidence Scoring
    |  - Damerau-Levenshtein edit distance
    |  - Trigram + bigram similarity
    |  - Token-level word matching
    |  - Composite confidence scoring
    |  - Top-3 suggestions for low confidence
    v
[ocr.js]             Integration + UI
    |  - Sequential multi-screenshot upload queue
    |  - Best-variant selection
    |  - Fallback strip OCR (3 horizontal strips)
    |  - Suggestions UI ("Did you mean?")
    |  - Manual correction modal
    |  - Session correction cache
```

### Lazy Loading

OCR scripts are **not** included in the initial page bundle. They are loaded dynamically when the user first triggers OCR in the optimizer. This saves ~1MB from the initial page load and is handled via dynamic `<script>` injection in `optimizer.js`.

## 3. Preprocessing Pipeline

### Skill Region Cropping

The pipeline first detects the layout from aspect ratio and crops to the skill panel:

| Layout            | Detection           | Crop Region         |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| PC (landscape)    | width/height >= 1.1 | x: 1-40%, y: 27-85% |
| Mobile (portrait) | width/height < 1.1  | x: 0-98%, y: 17-87% |

### Processing Steps

Each image runs through up to 9 steps. Multi-variant mode tests 4 configurations in parallel and picks the best:

| Step | Operation            | Parameters                             |
| ---- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Upscale              | 2x (standard) or 3x (high-res variant) |
| 2    | Grayscale            | Standard RGB luminance conversion      |
| 3    | CLAHE                | Clip limit 2.5, tile size 8x8          |
| 4    | Denoise              | 3x3 median filter                      |
| 5    | Sharpen              | Unsharp mask, amount 0.5 (optional)    |
| 6    | Adaptive threshold   | Sauvola with block radius 7-8, C=10    |
| 7    | Morphological close  | Dilate + erode, radius 1               |
| 8    | Deskew               | Optional, disabled by default          |
| 9    | Best-frame selection | Laplacian sharpness metric             |

### Multi-Variant Configs

| Variant        | Scale | Threshold         | Notes                              |
| -------------- | ----- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Standard       | 2x    | Sauvola adaptive  | Default, good all-around           |
| High-res       | 3x    | Sauvola + sharpen | Better for mobile screenshots      |
| Grayscale-only | 2x    | None              | Lets Tesseract handle binarization |
| Otsu           | 2x    | Global Otsu       | Better on uniform backgrounds      |

Best variant is selected by: `skillCount * 0.6 + (ocrConfidence / 100) * 0.4`

### Configuration

In `ocr-preprocess.js`, the `DEFAULT_CONFIG` object:

```js
const DEFAULT_CONFIG = {
  targetScale: 2, // 2x upscale (try 3 for mobile screenshots)
  enableCLAHE: true, // Adaptive contrast enhancement
  claheClipLimit: 2.5, // Higher = more contrast
  claheTileSize: 8, // Tile grid for local contrast
  enableDenoise: true, // Median filter (reduces noise)
  denoiseKernel: 3, // 3x3 kernel
  enableThreshold: true, // Adaptive binarization
  thresholdBlockSize: 15, // Larger = smoother threshold
  thresholdC: 10, // Bias constant
  enableMorphClose: true, // Fill thin glyph gaps
  morphCloseRadius: 1, // 1px structuring element
  enableSharpen: false, // Edge sharpening (helps low-res)
  multiVariant: true, // Run multiple configs in parallel
};
```

---

## 4. Fuzzy Matching

### Composite Match Score

The matcher computes a weighted composite of six signals for each candidate skill name:

```js
composite =
  editScore * 0.3 + // Damerau-Levenshtein edit distance
  trigramScore * 0.25 + // Trigram overlap (Jaccard)
  bigramScore * 0.1 + // Bigram overlap (Jaccard)
  tokenScore * 0.2 + // Word-level matching
  prefixScore * 0.05 + // Common prefix bonus
  lenRatio * 0.1; // Length similarity
```

Adjust weights if certain error types dominate:

- **Character substitutions** (OCR misreads): increase `editScore` weight
- **Word-level garbling**: increase `tokenScore` weight
- **Truncated text**: increase `prefixScore` weight

### Line Variant Generation

For each OCR line, 6 cleaned variants are tested:

1. Pipes-as-I (`|` to `I`), strip special chars
2. Strip pipes entirely
3. Strip trailing cost numbers
4. Strip hint/discount text then trailing numbers
5. Progressive word prefixes (handles trailing garbage)
6. CamelCase split for merged words (e.g., `Flowery7rManeuver` to `Flowery r Maneuver`)

### Confidence Scoring

Final confidence combines four signals:

| Signal                                                   | Weight |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Match score (composite above)                            | 40%    |
| Tesseract engine confidence                              | 35%    |
| OCR text quality (alpha ratio, length, symbol penalties) | 15%    |
| Image sharpness (Laplacian variance)                     | 10%    |

### Confidence Thresholds

In `ocr-matcher.js`, the `CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLDS` object controls UI behavior:

```js
const CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLDS = {
  HIGH: 0.85, // Green badge, no suggestions
  MEDIUM: 0.7, // Yellow badge
  LOW: 0.7, // Red badge, shows "Did you mean?" suggestions
};
```

- **HIGH (>= 85%)**: very likely correct, green badge
- **MEDIUM (70-84%)**: somewhat confident, yellow badge
- **LOW (< 70%)**: uncertain, red badge + top-3 suggestion buttons

Minimum confidence filter: **0.55** (skills below this are discarded entirely).

## 5. Fallback Strip OCR

When the primary pass detects fewer than 3 skills, a fallback runs targeted OCR on 3 horizontal strips:

| Strip  | Region  | Catches                             |
| ------ | ------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Top    | 0-40%   | Obtained/rare cards at top of panel |
| Mid    | 28-73%  | Skipped names in middle             |
| Bottom | 58-100% | Cards near buttons at bottom        |

High-confidence results from strips are merged into the main list.

---

## 6. Hint Level Extraction

The pipeline extracts hint levels from OCR text near skill names (within +/-7 lines):

- Matches: `Hint Lv X`, `H1nt`, `Hlnt`, `LV`, `Ly` (OCR-garbled variants)
- Matches discount format: `10% OFF`, `40% OFM`
- Fallback: infers hint level from cost using the discount table (10% = Lv1, 20% = Lv2, ... 40% = Lv5)

---

## 7. Skill Description Popup

Clicking any recognized skill name opens a **skill description popup** with:

- Skill name (with JP/EN toggle based on site language)
- Rarity, cost, and rating score
- Full description and activation conditions
- Support cards that offer the skill as a hint (filtered by server EN/JP)
- Characters with the skill as a potential skill (filtered by server)

The popup works across all pages: Optimizer, Calculator, Deck Builder, Hints, Skills Library, and Events. On mobile, it renders as a bottom sheet.

---

## 8. Updating the Skill Dictionary

The OCR matcher loads skills from `assets/uma_skills.csv`.

### CSV Format

```
skill_type,name,base_value,S_A,B_C,D_E_F,G,affinity_role
green,Concentration,508,...
golden,Shadow Break,700,...
```

### Adding New Skills

1. Add a row to `uma_skills.csv` with the correct `name` and `skill_type`
2. The matcher dictionary rebuilds automatically on page load
3. No code changes needed

### Bulk Update

1. Run `npm run refresh:data`
2. This refreshes `assets/skills_all.json` from GameTora and `assets/uma_skills.csv` from GameWith
3. Rebuild: just refresh the page

---

## 9. Session Correction Cache

When a user corrects an OCR result (via suggestion click or manual edit), the correction is stored in a session cache (`OCRMatcher.addCorrection()`).

- If the same garbled text appears again (e.g., in video capture frames), the corrected skill name is used immediately with 99% confidence
- The cache is cleared on page refresh
- No data is persisted to localStorage (privacy-safe)

---

## 10. Troubleshooting

### Common Failure Modes

| Symptom                     | Likely Cause                                | Fix                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| No skills detected          | Image too dark/bright or too low resolution | Enable Image Enhancement toggle; try 3x scale        |
| Wrong skill matched         | OCR garbles multiple characters             | Click the skill to correct; use suggestions if shown |
| All low confidence          | Poor image quality or compression artifacts | Use PNG screenshots, avoid JPEG                      |
| "Processing image..." hangs | Tesseract worker crashed                    | Refresh the page; try a smaller image                |
| Skills duplicated           | OCR reads same line twice                   | Already deduped; check for variant names             |

### Debug Mode

Enable via browser console:

```js
window.setOCRDebugMode(true);
```

After running OCR:

```js
window.showOCRDebug();
```

This shows all preprocessing variants tested, OCR confidence per variant, raw OCR text, and detected skills with scores.

### Disabling Preprocessing

If preprocessing causes issues:

1. Uncheck "Image Enhancement" in the UI
2. Or call `window.setOCRPreprocessing(false)` in console
3. OCR will run on the original image only

### Running Tests

Load the test harness dynamically:

```js
const s = document.createElement('script');
s.src = '/js/ocr-test.js';
document.head.appendChild(s);
```

Then run:

```js
await OCRTest.runAll();
```

Output includes unit test results (pass/fail counts), accuracy benchmarks (top-1 and top-3 accuracy), and individual test details.

### Performance

- Preprocessing: ~50-200ms per variant
- Multi-variant mode: ~200-800ms total (4 configs)
- Tesseract OCR: ~1-3 seconds per variant
- Total pipeline: ~2-5 seconds per screenshot
- No UI stalls (Tesseract runs in a web worker)
- OCR scripts are lazy-loaded (~1MB deferred from initial page load)
- When multiple screenshots are selected, they run sequentially through the same worker; the
  review opens after the batch with detections kept in file-selection order.
