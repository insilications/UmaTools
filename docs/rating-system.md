## 1. Overview

A character's **Total Rating** is the sum of three independent components:

![Rating Composition](images/rating-composition.svg)

```text
Total Rating = Stat Score + Unique Bonus + Skill Score
```

| Component | What It Measures |
| --- | --- |
| **Stat Score** | How high your five stats (Speed, Stamina, Power, Guts, Wisdom) are, scored using progressively increasing per-block rates. |
| **Unique Bonus** | A flat bonus based on the character's star level and unique skill level. |
| **Skill Score** | The sum of all selected skills' scores, evaluated against your race aptitudes. |

Each component is calculated independently and then summed to produce the final rating, which determines your badge tier (G through LS24).

---

## 2. Stat Scoring

Each of the five stats -- Speed, Stamina, Power, Guts, and Wisdom -- is clamped to the range **0 to 2500** and then scored independently. The scores for all five stats are summed to produce the total stat score.

### How It Works

The code stores a per-block multiplier for each 50-point stat block (50 entries covering stats 0-2500). The cumulative boundary scores at each 50-point interval are computed dynamically from these multipliers on page load.

![Stat Scoring Curve](images/stat-curve.svg)

The score grows slowly at low stats and accelerates dramatically at high stats -- the per-point rate ranges from **0.5** in the first block to **19.4** in blocks above stat 1750.

### Per-Block Multipliers

Each 50-point block of stats has a fixed per-point rate. The multiplier for each block:

| Block | Stats | Rate | Block | Stats | Rate | Block | Stats | Rate |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 0 | 0-49 | 0.5 | 17 | 850-899 | 3.9 | 34 | 1700-1749 | 13.9 |
| 1 | 50-99 | 0.8 | 18 | 900-949 | 4.1 | 35 | 1750-1799 | 17.3 |
| 2 | 100-149 | 1.0 | 19 | 950-999 | 4.2 | 36 | 1800-1849 | 19.4 |
| 3 | 150-199 | 1.3 | 20 | 1000-1049 | 4.3 | 37 | 1850-1899 | 19.4 |
| 4 | 200-249 | 1.6 | 21 | 1050-1099 | 5.2 | 38 | 1900-1949 | 19.4 |
| 5 | 250-299 | 1.8 | 22 | 1100-1149 | 5.5 | 39 | 1950-1999 | 19.4 |
| 6 | 300-349 | 2.1 | 23 | 1150-1199 | 6.6 | 40 | 2000-2049 | 19.4 |
| 7 | 350-399 | 2.4 | 24 | 1200-1249 | 6.8 | 41 | 2050-2099 | 19.4 |
| 8 | 400-449 | 2.6 | 25 | 1250-1299 | 6.9 | 42 | 2100-2149 | 19.4 |
| 9 | 450-499 | 2.8 | 26 | 1300-1349 | 11.0 | 43 | 2150-2199 | 19.4 |
| 10 | 500-549 | 2.9 | 27 | 1350-1399 | 11.0 | 44 | 2200-2249 | 19.4 |
| 11 | 550-599 | 3.0 | 28 | 1400-1449 | 11.0 | 45 | 2250-2299 | 19.4 |
| 12 | 600-649 | 3.1 | 29 | 1450-1499 | 11.0 | 46 | 2300-2349 | 19.4 |
| 13 | 650-699 | 3.3 | 30 | 1500-1549 | 11.0 | 47 | 2350-2399 | 19.4 |
| 14 | 700-749 | 3.4 | 31 | 1550-1599 | 11.0 | 48 | 2400-2449 | 19.4 |
| 15 | 750-799 | 3.5 | 32 | 1600-1649 | 12.5 | 49 | 2450-2499 | 19.4 |
| 16 | 800-849 | 3.9 | 33 | 1650-1699 | 12.5 | | | |

### Boundary Score Table

The cumulative score at each 50-point boundary (dynamically computed from multipliers):

| Stat | Score | | Stat | Score | | Stat | Score |
| ---: | ---: | --- | ---: | ---: | --- | ---: | ---: |
| 0 | 0 | | 850 | 2,000 | | 1700 | 9,425 |
| 50 | 25 | | 900 | 2,205 | | 1750 | 10,290 |
| 100 | 65 | | 950 | 2,415 | | 1800 | 11,260 |
| 150 | 115 | | 1000 | 2,630 | | 1850 | 12,230 |
| 200 | 180 | | 1050 | 2,890 | | 1900 | 13,200 |
| 250 | 260 | | 1100 | 3,165 | | 1950 | 14,170 |
| 300 | 350 | | 1150 | 3,495 | | 2000 | 15,140 |
| 350 | 455 | | 1200 | 3,835 | | 2050 | 16,110 |
| 400 | 575 | | 1250 | 4,180 | | 2100 | 17,080 |
| 450 | 705 | | 1300 | 4,730 | | 2150 | 18,050 |
| 500 | 845 | | 1350 | 5,280 | | 2200 | 19,020 |
| 550 | 990 | | 1400 | 5,830 | | 2250 | 19,990 |
| 600 | 1,140 | | 1450 | 6,380 | | 2300 | 20,960 |
| 650 | 1,295 | | 1500 | 6,930 | | 2350 | 21,930 |
| 700 | 1,460 | | 1550 | 7,480 | | 2400 | 22,900 |
| 750 | 1,630 | | 1600 | 8,105 | | 2450 | 23,870 |
| 800 | 1,805 | | 1650 | 8,730 | | 2500 | 24,840 |

### Formula

```text
idx       = floor(stat / 50)
remainder = stat % 50

base      = BOUNDARY_SCORES[idx]
blockDiff = BOUNDARY_SCORES[idx + 1] - base

statScore = base + round(blockDiff * remainder / 50)
```

Key details:

- At exact boundaries (remainder = 0), the score equals the table value directly.
- Between boundaries, `blockDiff / 50` acts as the effective per-point rate for that block, with rounding for precision.
- Stats above 2500 are clamped to 2500 before scoring. Stats below 0 are clamped to 0.

### Worked Example: stat = 1500

```text
idx       = floor(1500 / 50) = 30
remainder = 1500 % 50 = 0
base      = BOUNDARY_SCORES[30] = 6930

statScore = 6930
```

So a single stat at 1500 contributes **6,930** to the total stat score.

### Total Stat Score

```text
totalStatScore = calcStatScore(speed)
               + calcStatScore(stamina)
               + calcStatScore(power)
               + calcStatScore(guts)
               + calcStatScore(wisdom)
```

Maximum possible: 5 × 24,840 = **124,200** (all stats at 2500).

## 3. Unique Skill Bonus

The unique skill bonus is a flat addition based on two inputs: the character's **star level** and their **unique skill level**.

### Unique Bonus Formula

```text
uniqueBonus = uniqueLevel * multiplier
```

Where:

| Star Level | Multiplier |
| ---: | ---: |
| 1 or 2 | 120 |
| 3+ | 170 |

If `uniqueLevel` is 0, the bonus is 0.

### Examples

| Stars | Level | Calculation | Bonus |
| ---: | ---: | --- | ---: |
| 1--2 | 5 | 5 \* 120 | 600 |
| 3+ | 5 | 5 \* 170 | 850 |
| 3+ | 10 | 10 \* 170 | 1,700 |
| Any | 0 | 0 \* any | 0 |

---

## 4. Skill Scoring

Each skill has a **score** that contributes to the total rating. Scores can be either a flat number or an object containing multiple buckets that vary based on the character's race aptitudes.

### Bucket Selection

When a skill has a `checkType` (e.g., `"turf"`, `"mile"`, `"front"`), the game looks at the character's aptitude grade for that type and maps it to a score bucket:

| Aptitude Grade | Bucket |
| --- | --- |
| S, A | `good` |
| B, C | `average` |
| D, E, F | `bad` |
| Anything else | `terrible` |

If a skill has **no** `checkType`, the bucket is `"base"`.

### Valid Check Types

```text
turf, dirt, sprint, mile, medium, long, front, pace, late, end
```

These correspond to the ten aptitude selectors in the optimizer UI.

### Multi-Role Check Types

Some skills have compound check types (e.g., `"mile/turf"`). For these, the engine:

1. Splits the check type on `/`
2. Groups roles by category (surface, distance, style)
3. Takes the best multiplier per category
4. Multiplies across categories and applies to the base score

### Score Evaluation

The evaluation logic (`evaluateSkillScore`) works as follows:

1. If `skill.score` is a plain number, use it directly.
2. If `skill.score` is an object, look up `score[bucket]` based on the check type and aptitude.
3. If the bucket key is missing from the object, the score is **0**.

### Scores in Combos

When skills are combined through gold or circle linking:

- **Gold combo**: Only the gold skill's score counts. The prerequisite lower skill's score is set to 0 in the combo.
- **Circle combo**: Only the double-circle upgrade's score counts. The single-circle base's score is replaced.

This means you never "double-dip" on scores for linked skill pairs.

---

## 5. Skill Costs and Discounts

![Hint Discount Chart](images/hint-discount.svg)

### Base Costs

Base skill costs are sourced from:

1. **`assets/skills_all.json`** (primary source) -- contains detailed skill metadata including costs and relationships.
2. **`assets/uma_skills.csv`** (fallback) -- the skill database with 443+ skills.

When a skill is added to the optimizer, the base cost is stored in `row.dataset.baseCost` so discounting can be recalculated if the hint level changes.

### Hint Discount Table

Hint levels reduce the cost of a skill. The discount percentages are:

| Hint Level | Discount |
| ---: | ---: |
| 0 | 0% |
| 1 | 10% |
| 2 | 20% |
| 3 | 30% |
| 4 | 35% |
| 5 | 40% |

Note that hint levels 1--3 increase by 10% each, then the curve flattens: level 4 is only +5% over level 3, and level 5 is another +5%.

### Fast Learner

The **Fast Learner** toggle adds a flat **10%** discount that stacks additively with the hint discount.

### Final Cost Formula

```text
totalDiscount = hintDiscount + fastLearnerDiscount
finalCost     = floor(baseCost * max(0, 1 - totalDiscount))
```

The `max(0, ...)` ensures the multiplier never goes negative (though in practice the maximum combined discount is 50%: hint level 5 at 40% plus Fast Learner at 10%).

### Manual Cost Entries

If a user manually types a cost value into the cost field (rather than letting it auto-populate from the skill database), the manually entered value is used as-is. **Manual costs bypass discounting entirely** -- the optimizer uses whatever number is in the cost field.

### Discount Examples

| Base Cost | Hint Level | Fast Learner | Discount | Final Cost |
| ---: | ---: | --- | ---: | ---: |
| 200 | 0 | No | 0% | 200 |
| 200 | 3 | No | 30% | 140 |
| 200 | 5 | No | 40% | 120 |
| 200 | 3 | Yes | 40% | 120 |
| 200 | 5 | Yes | 50% | 100 |
| 170 | 4 | Yes | 45% | floor(170 \* 0.55) = 93 |

## 6. Skill Dependencies

Skills are not always independent. Three types of dependencies exist, and the optimizer handles each differently.

### Gold + Lower Linking

A gold (rare) skill typically requires a lower-rarity prerequisite skill. In the optimizer UI, adding a gold skill auto-creates a linked lower skill row below it.

The optimizer creates a **three-option decision group**:

| Option | Cost | Score | Description |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | Skip both skills entirely. |
| 2 | Lower cost | Lower score | Take the lower skill only. |
| 3 | Gold cost alone | Gold score only | Take the gold combo. The gold's listed cost already includes the lower skill cost, so no additional cost is charged for the lower. |

In the results, the lower skill shows as "included with [gold skill]" at 0 additional cost and 0 additional score.

### Circle Skill Linking

Single-circle skills can be upgraded to double-circle versions. Adding a single-circle skill auto-creates a linked double-circle upgrade row.

The optimizer creates a **three-option decision group**:

| Option | Cost | Score | Description |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | Skip both. |
| 2 | Single-circle cost | Single-circle score | Take the base version only. |
| 3 | Single-circle + double-circle (additive) | Double-circle score only | Take the combo. Both costs are paid, but only the upgrade's score counts. |

The key difference from gold linking: circle combo cost is **additive** (base + upgrade), while gold combo cost uses **only the gold cost** (which already subsumes the lower).

### Parent Dependencies

Some skills have a parent skill that must be taken first. If a child skill is selected by the optimizer, its parent is automatically included in the result. The optimizer builds dependency chains during the `buildGroups` phase, presenting choices of:

1. Skip both
2. Take parent only
3. Take parent + child (combined cost, child's score counts)

---

## 7. Optimization Engine

### Modes

The optimizer supports three modes, selectable via the mode dropdown:

#### Rating Mode (Default)

Maximizes the total skill score (sum of all selected skills' rating scores) within the budget constraint.

```text
objective = maximize(sum of ratingScore)
```

#### Aptitude Test Mode

Maximizes **aptitude points** first, then uses rating score as a tiebreaker among options with equal aptitude points.

Aptitude point values:

- **Gold/rare skill**: 1,200 points
- **Normal skill**: 400 points
- **Lower skill in a gold combo**: 0 points (does not count)

The combined score used for optimization:

```text
score = aptitudeScore * 100,000 + ratingScore
```

The large multiplier (100,000) ensures aptitude points always dominate, with rating acting purely as a tiebreaker.

#### Team Trials Mode

A separate optimization system with its own scoring. See `docs/team-trials.md` for details.

### Grouped Knapsack Algorithm

The core optimizer uses **dynamic programming** to solve a bounded 0/1 knapsack problem with **mutually exclusive groups** (also known as the group knapsack or multiple-choice knapsack problem).

#### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Collect valid skill rows**: Scan the optimizer table for rows with a recognized skill name and a numeric cost. Build an `items` array and `rowsMeta` array.

2. **Expand required skills**: If any skills are marked as required (locked), ensure their dependencies (parents, lower skills) are also included.

3. **Build decision groups** (`buildGroups`): Organize items into groups based on their relationships:
   - **Gold/lower combos**: 3 options (skip, lower only, gold combo)
   - **Circle combos**: 3 options (skip, base only, upgrade combo)
   - **Parent/child chains**: 3 options (skip, parent only, parent + child)
   - **Standalone skills**: 2 options (skip or take)

   Each item is used in exactly one group. A `used` array prevents any item from appearing in multiple groups.

4. **Filter for required skills**: If any items in a group are required, remove group options that do not include those required items. If this leaves any group with zero valid options, the optimization is infeasible.

5. **Run DP**: For each group `g` (1 to G) and each budget level `b` (0 to B):
   - If the group has a "none" option, inherit the previous group's value (`dpPrev[b]`).
   - For each non-none option `k` in the group, check if its cost fits within budget `b`. If so, compute `candidate = dpPrev[b - cost] + score` and keep the best.
   - Record the chosen option in `choice[g][b]` for backtracking.

6. **Backtrack**: Starting from `choice[G][B]`, walk backwards through the groups to reconstruct which option was chosen for each group.

7. **Add remaining required items**: If any required items were not picked up during backtracking, add them to the result with their original cost and score.

8. **Error handling**: If required skills exceed the budget, the optimizer returns an error (`required_unreachable`).

#### Memory Optimization

The DP uses a **rolling two-array approach**: only `dpPrev` and `dpCurr` are maintained (rather than a full G x B matrix). The full `choice` matrix is still needed for backtracking, but the dp values themselves use O(2 x B) instead of O(G x B) space.

```text
dpPrev = [0, 0, 0, ..., 0]       // B+1 elements, initialized to 0
dpCurr = [NEG, NEG, ..., NEG]    // B+1 elements, initialized to -1e15

for each group g:
    for each budget b:
        try each option, update dpCurr[b]
    swap dpPrev and dpCurr
    reset dpCurr to NEG
```

After the loop completes, `dpPrev[B]` contains the maximum achievable score within the full budget.

### Auto Build (Ideal Build)

The Auto Build feature filters skills before running the same optimization engine, then highlights matching rows in the results.

#### Filtering Rules

Skills are filtered based on the selected **auto-build targets** (checkboxes for each aptitude type plus "General"):

- **Skills with a `checkType`**: Included only if:
  1. That `checkType` is selected as a target, AND
  2. The character's aptitude for that type is **S or A** (i.e., the bucket is `"good"`)

- **Skills without a `checkType`**: Included only if the **"General"** target is selected.

#### Linked Counterparts

When filtering, the optimizer also includes linked counterparts (gold lower skills, circle upgrade skills) so that `buildGroups` can form proper combo groups. Without this, linked skills would be treated as standalone items and evaluated incorrectly.

## 8. Rating Badges

![Badge Tier Progression](images/badge-tiers.svg)

The total rating maps to one of **298 badge tiers** across three rank families. Each badge has a minimum threshold -- you receive the highest badge whose minimum threshold is less than or equal to your rating.

### Base Ranks (G through SS+)

| Min Rating | Badge | | Min Rating | Badge | | Min Rating | Badge |
| ---: | --- | --- | ---: | --- | --- | ---: | --- |

### Legend Ranks (LG through LS24) -- NEW

The JP 5th Anniversary update added Legend (L) ranks above Ultimate. Each Legend family has a base rank plus 24 numbered sub-tiers (e.g., LG, LG1, LG2, ... LG24).

| Family | Base Threshold | Top Sub-Tier | Top Threshold |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| LG | 76,000 | LG24 | 90,900 |
| LF | 91,400 | LF24 | 104,800 |
| LE | 105,400 | LE24 | 118,200 |
| LD | 118,800 | LD24 | 132,000 |
| LC | 132,500 | LC24 | 146,100 |
| LB | 146,600 | LB24 | 160,500 |
| LA | 161,100 | LA24 | 175,300 |
| LS | 175,900 | LS24 | 190,400 |

Legend tiers increment at ~550-650 rating per sub-tier. Full threshold data is in `RATING_BADGE_MINIMA` in `js/rating-shared.js`.

### Progress Bar

The UI displays a progress bar beneath the badge showing:

- Your **current badge** (rendered as a sprite from the badge sheet)
- The **next badge threshold** and its label
- **Points remaining** to reach the next tier (e.g., "+342")
- A **fill percentage** based on progress between the previous and next thresholds

At maximum rank (LS24 at 190,400+), the progress bar shows "Max rank reached" with a full fill.

## 9. Tips

- **Set race aptitudes first.** Aptitude grades control which score bucket is used for every skill with a checkType. Changing aptitudes can dramatically shift which skills are valuable.

- **Prioritize skills whose checkType matches your strongest aptitudes (S or A).** Skills evaluated in the `"good"` bucket generally have much higher scores than the same skills evaluated in `"average"` or `"bad"`.

- **Keep costs accurate and set hint levels for proper discounting.** The optimizer can only make good decisions if cost data reflects what you will actually pay in-game. Use the hint level dropdown rather than manually editing costs when possible.

- **For gold skills, include their lower versions so the optimizer can evaluate combos.** When you add a gold skill, the linked lower skill row is created automatically. Leave it in place so the optimizer can compare "lower only" vs. "gold combo" vs. "skip both."

- **Use required locks sparingly.** Locking a skill as required forces the optimizer to include it regardless of efficiency. This reduces the optimizer's flexibility to find the best overall combination within your budget.

- **Use Auto Build for a baseline, then refine.** Run Auto Build to see the ideal skill set for your aptitudes, lock the must-haves, add any additional skills you want considered, and re-optimize.

- **Stats above 2500 are clamped and provide no additional rating benefit.** There is no reason to push any individual stat above 2500 for rating purposes. Spread the points across stats instead.

- **Rounding matters for intermediate stat values.** Between 50-point boundaries, the score is computed by rounding the proportional block difference. At exact boundaries (e.g., 1000, 1050), the score equals the lookup table value directly.

- **Pick Rating or Aptitude Test mode based on your goal.** The optimizer changes its objective accordingly -- Rating mode purely maximizes skill score, while Aptitude Test mode prioritizes earning aptitude points.
