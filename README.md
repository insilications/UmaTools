## Features

### [Event Helper](https://daftuyda.moe/events)

Real-time event lookup powered by OCR. Capture your game screen, and UmaTools reads the event name, shows all options, scores them, and highlights the best choice.

### [Support Hint Finder](https://daftuyda.moe/hints)

Search for support cards by skill hints. Add hints as filter chips, choose AND/OR matching, and filter by rarity (SSR / SR / R) to find the cards you need.

### [Skill Optimizer](https://daftuyda.moe/optimizer)

Maximize your build's rating or Team Trials consistency under a skill-point budget. Set your race config and aptitudes, add skills with hint levels, and let the optimizer pick the best combination. Supports gold/lower linking, circle skill upgrades, build saving, and shareable links.

- **Rating mode** — maximizes total rating score
- **Team Trials mode** — prioritizes skill activation consistency over raw score
- **Aptitude Test mode** — maximizes aptitude test points, then rating as tiebreaker

### [Rating Calculator](https://daftuyda.moe/calculator)

Standalone rating projection. Enter your final stats, star rarity, unique skill level, and selected skills to see the projected rating and badge progress. Supports all ranks from G through the new Legend (LS24) tier.

### [Deck Builder](https://daftuyda.moe/deck)

Build training decks with 1 main character + up to 6 support cards. Filter by type, rarity, and aptitudes. View combined stat bonuses, skill hints, and synergy analysis. Save decks locally, share via encoded URL, or open directly in the Skill Optimizer.

### [Skill Library](https://daftuyda.moe/skills)

Browse the complete skill database with detailed metadata — cost, rating score, efficiency (score per SP), type, and category. Sort, search, and filter by skill type. Click any skill for a popup with full description, activation conditions, support card sources, and character availability.

### [Rank Breakdown](https://daftuyda.moe/rank-breakdown)

Reference table for all rating badge tiers from G through LS24, including threshold ranges and icon sprites used by the calculator/optimizer.

### [Stamina Check](https://daftuyda.moe/stamina)

Verify whether your uma has enough stamina for the race. Set distance, surface, condition, style, and mood, then enter stats and recovery skills to compare needed vs. actual stamina.

### [Accel Checker](https://daftuyda.moe/accel)

Check which acceleration skills are valid for a given race setup. Select distance, surface, running style, and position to see which accel skills can activate with VAC timing logic. Supports both global-only and JP skill pools.

### [Umadle](https://daftuyda.moe/umadle)

A daily guessing game. Pick an uma, compare stats and hint grids, and narrow down the answer.

### [Randomizer](https://daftuyda.moe/random)

Roll a random 5-card support deck or pick a random uma. Filter by rarity, exclude cards you don't want, and optionally enable 2A- speed.

<details>
<summary><strong>Local Development</strong></summary>

Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/download).

```bash
npm i -g vercel
git clone https://github.com/insilications/UmaTools.git
cd UmaTools
vercel dev --local
```

</details>

## Data Sync

Refresh only GameTora skill metadata:

```bash
npm run sync:skills-all
```

Refresh skill CSVs (`assets/uma_skills.csv`, `assets/uma_skills_jp.csv`):

```bash
npm run sync:uma-skills
```

This command also writes scrape metadata to `.cache_gamewith/gamewith_metadata.json`.
Both skill CSVs are expanded from `assets/skills_all.json` so Global and JP modes follow the full
GameTora skill list. GameWith simulator rows are used as the score/affinity overlay; fan/unofficial
EN is stored in `alias_name`, and localized EN is stored in `localized_name`.

Full skill data refresh (recommended):

```bash
npm run refresh:data
```

## Checks

```bash
npm run format
npm run lint
npm test
npm run check
```
